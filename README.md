# This is how a index handle the controllers part, this way i dont have to include extra files

<p>
  maybe for you will be not the most beautiful code
  but let me tell you , it will work as fine as the example of the course.
  this is just the router + the 404 page the core file its incomplete yet.
  that is the reason i will post it when i feel that it is a decent code to share.
  thanks for all your feedback.
